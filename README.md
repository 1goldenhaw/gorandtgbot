Hi there!
This code on golang (was tested on version 1.19).

The code implements the functionality for telegram bot - to get random message from telegram channel, that the bot is admin on it.
To start :
1) you need to fill env by your telegram bot token (ask it from @botfather).
2) You need to append channelID of your channel (forward something to @getmyid_bot to get it).
3) Press start in chat with bot and press "update" / "Обновить", then "get random post" / "Рандомный пост"
